## 🚨 Critical Issues to Resolve Before Production

### High Priority
1. **Insufficient Funds Error Handling**
   - **Issue**: Generic error message for insufficient funds
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience, confusion
   - **Fix Required**: Implement specific error message parsing
   - **Timeline**: Before production deployment

2. **Service Unavailable Handling**
   - **Issue**: Generic error when M-Pesa service is down
   - **Impact**: Users don't understand the issue
   - **Fix Required**: Specific service unavailable message with alternatives
   - **Timeline**: Before production deployment

### Medium Priority
1. **Enhanced Callback Retry Logic**
   - **Issue**: Basic retry mechanism for failed callbacks
   - **Impact**: Potential missed payment confirmations
   - **Fix Required**: Implement exponential backoff retry
   - **Timeline**: Next iteration
